            Rock climbing is an incredibly fun and technical sport. There are so many different levels to climbing,
             and so many fun new things to learn every time you get to go. If you're just starting out, it may be worth it to 
             explore some of the training options that your local gym offers. Getting pointers from people that have been 
             climbing their whole lives is one of the best ways to learn proper technique, and ensure that you don't pick up 
             any bad habits as you begin. Don't worry about being a beginner either! Rock climbing is one of the most inclusive and 
             encouraging sports you could find, and most people that are at the gym are more than happy to help you learn and improve!<br>__________________________<br>
            
             Below are several graphs and charts that may help you learn a little more about climbing, and even find the 
             nearest rock climbing gym to you!

            <h2>Alex Honnold</h2>
            <p>Alex Honnold is one of, if not the most, famous climber in the world. He is particularly well known for his 
                tendency to participate in "Free Solo" climbing. This involves meticulously planning out, and practicing, 
                extremely difficult and technical outdoor climbs in order to eventually summit them without the use of safety
                equipment. The crown jewel in his free solo cap was his completion of the Freerider route on the face of El
                Capitan in Yosemite National park. A feat made particularly famous by the documentary that was released about 
                that climb back in 2017. (Check out the trailer right there!!) ðŸ‘‰
